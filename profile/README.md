This project was abandoned.

I dislike doing frontend development too much, and working on the Midoku app
was always a chore instead of being fun. But I might keep the extensions system
and integrate it with Mihon instead of developing a new app, so that I can focus
on the fun side of things. This probably won't be under the Midoku organization,
but rather under my personal account if I decide to continue working on it.
